So what is TDD?
Test Driven Development
TDD Cycle
1. write a fail test(red state)
2. make a pass test(green state)
3. refactor code(blue state)

// let create the fail test
1. I need to add dependency
my example is bank account
so bank account behaviour are
deposit and withdraw

// the last one is refactor
code format
